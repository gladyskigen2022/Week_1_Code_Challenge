# Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

* Writing a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. 
* If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. 
* Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), 
* It should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
* For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. 
* If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
